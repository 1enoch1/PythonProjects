# PythonProjects

Hi! Here is a brief insight into some of the Python projects that I have completed to date. This repo presents the following projects:

1. SONGSCRAPER.PY - A Song Lyrics Scraper that works to filter out specified profanities per line
2. PROJ1 - A Python program that implements some Language modelling principles such as Unigram & Bigram modelling on specific text excerpts present in training and test text files 
3. PROJ2 - A Python program that implements Part-of-speech tagging and calculates Prior probabilities for specific sentence excerpts within training and test text files 
4. Task 2 - A Python Program that actuates Sentiment Classifier. To achieve this the following was completed:
- Removing stop words from the English language.
- Only considering letters and removing all numerical characters.
- Converting all text to lowercase.
- Stemming the text using the Snowball stemmer from the NLTK module.
- write the classification along with the PhraseID to a csv file.
