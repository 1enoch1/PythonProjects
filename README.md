# PythonProjects

Hi! Here is a brief insight into some of the Python projects that I have completed to date. This repo presents the following projects:

1. A Song Lyrics Scraper that works to filter out specified profanities per line
2. A Python program that implements some Language modelling principles such as Unigram & Bigram modelling on specific text excerpts present in training and test text files 
3. A Python program that implements Part-of-speech tagging and calculates Prior probabilities for specific sentence excerpts within training and test text files
